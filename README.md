# Nankai Document

This unofficial LaTeX package provides a class for creating documents for people working with Nankai University or maybe even inside it.

This project is based on [huawei â€“ Template for Huawei documents](https://ctan.org/pkg/huawei).

The user's guide can be found at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/alumik/nankai-document/releases).

Disclaimer: This is **NOT** a product of Nankai University. This package is created in order to help some people to render some documents in LATEX format. You are welcome to use it at your own risk.
